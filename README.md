CowLocalizer is a project designed and developed for the monitoring of "animals" without relying on 4G like many other providers.
There are populations where the access of an internet access line with sufficient speed and stability is still not available .So ,keeping such areas in mind, LoRa technology is used in this project, which is a form of data transmission with low consumption and long range.
